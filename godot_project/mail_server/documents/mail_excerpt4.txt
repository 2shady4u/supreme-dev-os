Hello, Lucas,

I just had a board meeting with my shareholders and we aren't happy with where the project is going.
At this rate of development, Supreme Dev OS will miss this quarter's release window.
Also, there are concerns that Supreme Dev OS might not be adopted as broadly as our initial estimates indicate.

You've been harrowing me about insufficient manpower since the beginning of the project.
As a result, I'm assigning a new member to the team.

Brock Zhu will be responsible for implementing `Pantheon Vision`, a revolutionary new virtualization program that will allow users to run Supreme Dev OS on their device, regardlesss of their available hardware.

I expect you to fully colloborate with him on the implemention of this new flagship program and report back to me with results ASAP.

I hope we are clear here,
Andrew Pantheon
CEO of Pantheon Incorporated
