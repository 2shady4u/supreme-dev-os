Hana,

Andrew Pantheon is planning to get rid of me in some way.
I was finally able to hack me way into his personal files.
Pantheon Inc. has outstanding debt in the millions, this company is going under soon and there's some strange happening around here lately.

Here's my login, in case something goes wrong and you don't hear from me again:

Hello Hana,

Previous mail was an overreaction and should be ignored.
There's no imminent danger to my wellbeing.
Please do not worry about me.

Greetings,
Lucas Tillborg
