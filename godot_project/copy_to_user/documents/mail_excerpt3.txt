Hey Lucas,

NOTE FOR NEXT TIME:
Encrypt your files in a less unusual format!
I first had to find and install the necessary decryption software (whose name you didn't tell me btw!) and then I had to decrypt your file.
ALL THIS WHILE THE OS IS CRASHING RANDOMLY EVERY FEW MINUTES!!!

*angry rant over*

Anyway, after a few crashes I figured it out and Supreme Dev OS is finally running...

I'll get back to you once I do some actual testing!

Toodles,
Hana

PS: Maybe also better if you add the encryptor to the blocklist to avoid users unnecessarily tampering with encrypted files?
