-------------------

Dear Mr. Pantheon,

I won't be able to finish Supreme Dev OS by the deadline.
Everything is crashing and, with all due respect, the drivers you delivered to me are crap.
I don't have an issue with out-sourcing part of the development process, but there are certain minimal standards that need to be upheld!

I was promised resources, but have received none whatsoever.

I need more time!

Greetings,
Lucas Tillborg

Look Lucas, I'm going to be blunt with you, when I hired it wasn't because you were the best. 
It wasn't even because you were second best.

I hired you because you told me you could the job done.

Respect the release deadline or there will be consequences.

Andrew Pantheon
CEO of Pantheon Incorporated
