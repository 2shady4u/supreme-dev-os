Hey Hanna!

Andrew is busting my balls to release Supreme Dev OS as soon as possible!
I've sent you a release candidate so if you would test it out, that would help me immensely.

Since I don't have time to fix every single tiny bug, please don't overdo it and just give me the bigger ones.

Cheers,
Lucas Tillborg

PS: Thanks for helping me out for free!
I know you are quite busy and I really do appreciate you helping me on such hort notice!

Hey Lucas,

I think I correctly installed everything, but I keep getting blue-screened every few minutes...
The only message I get is the following:
"Corrupted driver detected... Please contact your nearest Pantheon Fulfillment Center"

Am I doing something wrong? How do I get Supreme Dev OS running without crashing at random?

Greetings,
Hanna

PS: Happy to help you!

Hi Hanna,

I do hope this doesn't happen consistently, but I think that the drivers were corrupted during installation.
You'll probably have to re-install them by going into the boot menu.
Accessing the boot screen can be done by pressing the restart button for about 6-8 seconds in the login screen (or the crash screen).

You'll need a Pantheon id and password to login.
I'll send you those in an encrypted mail cause Supreme Dev OS has enough problems without hackers messing things up as well.

Cheers,
Lucas Tillborg
