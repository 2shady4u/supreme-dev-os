Walkthrough for Supreme Dev OS
###------------------------###

It might be a bit unclear, but the main goal of this puzzle game is indeed to get `Godot.exe` running so you can, hopefully, start making some sick games.

I do recommend that you attempt to solve the puzzles by yourself before reading these spoilers...
However, if you are stuck... then this might be just the right document for you!

------------------------------
0. Godot.exe keeps crashing and I don't know why :(

You should read the actual failure message that appears on the failure screen!
I know that some gamers don't like to read and just skip through dialogues and such, but this game does require you to read stuff!

------------------------------
1. According to the failure message, I need to update my Pantheon DRM Certifier, but I don't know how!

As in most operating systems, a terminal (Terminal.exe) is provided for you that is able execute several commands.
One of these commands is the `update` command which requires you to input a program_id.

Your obvious mission is to find the program_id of the Pantheon DRM Certifier and update it!

------------------------------
2. I can't seem to find the program_id of the Pantheon DRM Certifier!

All installed programs (that are not drivers) can be listed in the terminal using the `list`-command.
One of those will be the Pantheon DRM certifier, thus the `update`-command can be executed as such:

update pantheon_drm_certifier

The above command takes a while to execute, but after waiting about a second you should have your Certifier updated to the latest version!

------------------------------
3. Godot.exe still fails due to the Barracuda driver not being up-to-date!

Obviously, you will have to update the barracuda driver in some way... 
Now that the Pantheon DRM Certifier is updated, you can browse the filesystem using the Olympus program.
Maybe there's something in the filesystem that can help you?

------------------------------
4. I read all the mails but I still have no idea what to do!

One of the mails explains how to access the Boot menu.
Basically you will have to press the `R` key (= the restart key as stated in the Failure window!) for about 6-8 seconds in either the Failure or Login window.
This might take a while and you'll have to be patient...

------------------------------
5. I am in the Boot menu but I can't login! Where can I find the proper credentials?

As discussed in the mails by Lucas and Hana, the boot credentials are encrypted in the `boot_cred.enc`-file.
You'll have to open this file using the Olympus program.

------------------------------
6. Olympus crashes the OS when I attempt to open the encrypted file and I can't figure what program I should install!

The necessary program_id has been blocklisted by Lucas and thus won't show up in the Failure window.
But there was a time (somewhere in the past) when this program was NOT blocklisted and thus, as a direct result, would have to show up in the Failure window.
Maybe there's a place where crash logs are saved by the OS?

------------------------------
7. I don't know which of the crash logs to open! There are so many!

Checking the mails shows that Hana decrypted the encrypted file on the 8th of January, so you should only check the crash logs of that particular date.

------------------------------
8. I still can't find the necessary program_id of the decryption program!

It should be definitely be one of the files! Anyway if you really can't find it:

install enigma_encryptor

That should do the trick! Now try opening the `boot_cred.enc`-file again in Olympus!

------------------------------
9. I updated Barracuda in the Boot Menu, but `Godot.exe` still crashes due to not having root privileges!

Seems like your account just doesn't have the proper admin rights to use Godot.
You'll probably have to switch accounts in some way....How?
Maybe there's some hidden commands somewhere or something that you might input in the terminal?

------------------------------
10. I don't know where to find hidden commands!?

Hidden commands are found in the Boot Menu. Different drivers have different commands that can be used in the terminal!
One of them might help you along!

------------------------------
11. I still can't progress! Even after finding out the hidden commands and trying them all...

One of the hidden commands is `fetch_mail`, which contacts the Panther Mail Server and automatically downloads any new mails to your `documents`-folder.
After executing it you should have several new mails available to read using Olympus!

------------------------------
12. I read the new mails... but I don't find any useful information at all!!!

Lucas literally gives away his account's ID and password. You can input both of them in the Account tab of the Settings window and switch to his account!
The settings window can be opened by pressing the `start`-button on the left-side of the taskbar.

------------------------------
13. I switched to Lucas' account, but I keep getting logged out due to some deadline related issue...

If only there was a way to stop Brenda (the Articifical Intelligence) from logging you out each time!

------------------------------
14. Stop being a cryptic asshole and tell me already!

You can uninstall/disable Brenda by uninstalling her driver in the Boot Menu... that should do the trick!

------------------------------
15. I logged in as Lucas and don't know what to do?

Check Lucas' personal folder for any new clues! He might have left something there that will allow you to get root privileges!

------------------------------
16. Godot.exe launches the Godot Editor but any button/tab that I touch crashes the editor!

That's the end of the game... I hope you at least a marginal amount of fun!
